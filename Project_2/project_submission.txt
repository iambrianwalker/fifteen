Benefits of Project Methodology:
Sprints are probably the best use of this methodology. They are short spans in which a certain version of the project was worked on and it allows me to group all of that work in a sort of version control to go back to if I mess up a newer version of the game. It also gave me milestones and focus on particular features, making it easier to focus on specific parts of the project.
